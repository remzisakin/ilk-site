# ilk-site

This repository contains the static marketing pages and the `fullstack-newsletter-llm` application.

## Running the application

From the repository root you can use the npm scripts that forward to the application package:

```bash
npm install --prefix fullstack-newsletter-llm
npm start
```

`npm start` proxies to `fullstack-newsletter-llm`'s start command so you no longer need to change directories before starting the server.
